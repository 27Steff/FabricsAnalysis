# FabricsAnalysis
Data Scrapping with beautifulSoup and Selenium, Analysis with pandas

In this project, I used web scraping techniques to gather data from various online sources with the goal of identifying the top-selling fabrics and understanding their pricing dynamics across different platforms.

I compiled a comprehensive dataset so I could extracted crucial information such as sales volumes and pricing details for a wide array of fabrics.

Through analysis, we discovered the most popular fabrics among consumers and businesses. Furthermore, by examining pricing data across multiple sources, we found the common price points for each fabric type, offering valuable insights into pricing trends and market competitiveness.
